Take the following into consideration:

1. An individual human person has inherent power
2. Governments and organizations of people derive their power from the people who submit to it.
   No people? No power
3. The power of a person may be amplified, exploited, suppressed, given away, or left in possession of that person
4. Human beings are social animals
5. Our capacity for social connections is generally limited
